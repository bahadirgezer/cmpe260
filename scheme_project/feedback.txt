parsing expressions was fun, now it's ruined.

Jokes aside I did struggle a lot with this project.
Racket being a functional language really tripped me 
up. 

There could've been a eval_sequence.py to evaluate the 
generated sequence. Just generation doesn't help very 
much.

Lastly, I hope we have time to object to our first and 
second midterm grades. We still don't know our grades 
and the semester is almost over.
